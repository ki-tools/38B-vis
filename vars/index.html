The codes assigned to each country are those used by the UN Statistics Division and the ISO (International Organization for Standardization).","YEAR reports the year when the survey was fielded, as a four-digit variable. In some cases, the DHS was conducted over the course of two years (e.g., Ethiopia 2010-2011), but YEAR always gives a single year.  For full information about the timing of the surveys, please consult the IPUMS-DHS Sample Descriptions page.","IDHSPID is an identifying number unique to person in a given sample.  It is a concatenation of SAMPLE and CASEID.","IDHSHID is an identifying number unique to a specific household in a given sample.  It is a concatenation of SAMPLE, CLUSTERNO and HHNUM.","DHSID is the 14-character DHS identification code for DHS clusters constructed from the 2-character country code, the 4-digit survey year, and the 8-digit cluster identification number. DHSID is available for every IPUMS-DHS sample and uniquely identifies clusters across samples. It serves as the unique linking key between IPUMS-DHS microdata and DHS cluster shapefiles.","IDHSPSU is an identifying number unique to the primary sampling unit in a given sample.  This variable is a concatenation of SAMPLE (which uniquely identifies each country- and year-specific sample) and PSU (the numbered primary sampling units within a given sample).","IDHSSTRATA is an identifying number unique to the sampling strata in a given sample.  This variable is a concatenation of SAMPLE (which uniquely identifies each country- and year-specific sample) and STRATA (groups of geographically similar areas, from which primary sampling units are drawn).\n\nThe variable STRATA, and hence IDHSSTRATA, are unavailable for samples from DHS Phase 1 (prior to 1990).","CASEID is the unique identifier for each woman in a given sample year.  Using CASEID and CLUSTERNO, analysts can link IPUMS-DHS data to the original DHS datasets to attach variables that are not currently available in IPUMS-DHS.  For example, researchers can use CASEID and CLUSTERNO to link variables from the IPUMS-DHS with other variables from the Woman's Recode file to merge country-specific variables, or to the Household or Couples Recode file to attach variables that are not yet part of IPUMS-DHS. \n\nIn most samples, users can identify women who are in the same household by using the first 12 characters of CASEID (and CLUSTERNO (V001)), as this indicates a unique household identifier.  \n\nCASEID is generally created by The DHS Program using the variables CLUSTERNO (V001), HHNUM (V002), and LINENO (V003), with the last three characters indicating the respondent's line number in the household file.\n\nFor instructions on how to create links between IPUMS-DHS data and DHS source data, see the User Note on \"Merging IDHS and DHS Data.\"","HHID is an identifying number unique to each household in a given sample.","PSU (V021) is the variable indicating the  primary sampling unit  or PSU. It should be used along with the variable DOMAIN (V023) to account for the impact of the sample design clustering on the variance estimates and standard errors. \n\nThe DHS Recode Manuals for Phase 2 forward describe this variable as follows:\n\n \nPrimary sampling unit is a number assigned to sample points to identify the primary sampling units for use in the calculation of sampling errors. This variable is usually the same as the cluster number and/or the ultimate area unit, but may differ if the sample design required a multistage selection process.See the notes on DHS webpage \"Using sample weights\" on variance estimation for additional information.","STRATA (V022) defines the pairings or groupings of primary sampling units used in the calculation of sampling errors when using the Taylor series expansion method.\n\nIn two-stage sampling, The DHS Program may first group small geographic areas, such as enumeration areas from the last census, into broad strata defined jointly by region and urban versus rural areas within a region. In the second stage of sampling, a subset of geographic areas (sample clusters) are selected as the sites for interviewing from within defined strata. \n\nSTRATA is not the same as DOMAIN (V023). (Domains represent statistically representative areas for which valid summary statistics can be calculated for a survey, such as provinces and national urban versus rural combined areas, as described in the survey's final report.) The DHS Program recommends using STRATA along with the variable PSU (V021) to account for the impact of the sample design clustering on the estimates of variance and standard errors. \n\nWhen pooling samples, users are advised to use IDHSSTRATA, which provides a unique numeric value for each stratum across all samples. IDHSSTRATA concatenates the variables SAMPLE and STRATA.\n\nFor information on using the STRATA variable to control for complex sample design, consult the latest Guide to DHS Statistics at The DHS Program website.","DOMAIN (V023) defines the basic geographic units for which the sample was designed to yield representative estimates. \n\nThe DHS Recode Manual describes DOMAIN as follows:\n\n \nFor example, if the sample was designed to be self-weighting within region, this variable would define those regions; if the sample was designed to be self-weighting within major urban areas, other urban areas and rural areas, this variable would define the major urban, other urban and rural areas. If the sample is self-weighted at the national level, this variable is code 0.When national estimates are desired, users should include survey design variables, including DOMAIN (V023) and PSU (V021), and the correct sample weights (e.g., PERWEIGHT (V005)) to adjust sampling errors to account for DHS' sample design.\n\nIn most countries, DOMAIN defines the stratification for the sample (generally either regional or national).  However, some countries use two levels of stratification, such as region and urban/rural areas.  Users should check for the correct stratification design by consulting the Final Report(s) for the sample(s) of interest (particularly the Introduction and Sample Design sections and Implementation Appendix).","HHNUM (V002) is the number identifying the household in which the respondent was interviewed, within each sample.   \n\nTo identify unique households in most samples, researchers must use HHNUM with CLUSTERNO (V001).  \n\nFor most samples, HHNUM and CLUSTERNO can be used to merge IPUMS-DHS data from the women's file to DHS Household Recode files, to incorporate household variables not yet available in the IPUMS-DHS.  However, in some household files, HHNUM and CLUSTERNO do not uniquely identify households in the DHS Household Recode file. \n\nFor information about the IPUMS-DHS samples where HHNUM and CLUSTERNO are not sufficient to uniquely identify households, and for guidance on what further steps to take for linking files in such cases, please consult the User Note on Linking.","CLUSTERNO (V001) reports the cluster number for the person's de facto residence.\n\nAccording to the DHS Sampling Manual, \"A cluster is the smallest geographical survey statistical unit for DHS surveys. It consists of a number of adjacent households in a geographical area. For DHS surveys, a cluster corresponds either to an [enumeration area], or a segment of a large [enumeration area].\"  The most recent census for a country, which divided all territory into enumeration areas to ensure full coverage of the population, often provides the sampling frame for a DHS survey.\n \nCLUSTERNO is the variable indicating the  primary sampling unit  or PSU. It should be used along with the variable STRATA to account for the impact of the sample design clustering on the estimates of variance and standard errors. \n\nSee the notes on DHS webpage  \"Use sample weights\" on variance estimation for additional information.\n\nCLUSTERNO (V001) and HHNUM (V002) can be used to merge the women's individual recode file to the household recode file.  See the DHS webpage  Merging Datasets on variables to be used for linking data sets.","LINENO (V003) reports the number of the line on which the DHS interviewer recorded the woman's name, when filling out the household schedule.  After asking \"Please give me the names of the persons who usually live in your household or are staying with you now, starting with the head of the household,\" the interviewer recorded each name in turn on successively numbered lines printed on the household survey form.","PERWEIGHT (V005) is an 8-digit variable with 6 implied decimal places, which should be used as a weighting factor to produce representative numbers accurately describing the surveyed population.\n\nWhile the DHS Recode Manuals direct the researcher to divide the original weight variable by 1,000,000 before applying the weighting factor to the original DHS data files, it is not necessary to modify the value of PERWEIGHT before applying this weight to cases in IPUMS-DHS. \n\nPERWEIGHT should be used to weight nearly all tabulations made using IPUMS-DHS data.  Occasionally, as with the domestic violence variables, a subset of respondents are randomly selected to answer questions from a survey module, and a specialized weight such as DVWEIGHT should be used instead. \n\nNote: The 6 implied decimal places in PERWEIGHT mean that the last six digits of the eight-digit variable are decimal digits, but there is no actual decimal in the data.","POPWT is a population adjustment factor created by IPUMS to generate count estimates of household members for samples that are nationally representative. See our documentation for more information about how POPWT was created.","AWFACTT is a 5-digit variable (in IPUMS-DHS) with 2 implied decimal places that is used to create total population estimates for all women of childbearing age, for those samples interviewing only ever-married women. A post from DHS senior staff member Tom Pullum on the DHS Users Forum explains, \nThe all-woman factors are needed when you are trying to estimate something for all women, but you have to work with ever-married women because that's all you have in the sample. An example is when you want to estimate a fertility rate for all women but you only have the births and exposure for ever-married women.  You have to assume that (a) never-married women have no births and (b) awfact/100 is a multiplier to inflate exposure for ever-married women to exposure for all women.   \n\nFor surveys that used a sampling frame of all women of childbearing age, AWFACTT has a value of 100 (or 1.00, with two decimal places), and thus has no effect on the survey statistics when used as a multiplier.  For samples that included only ever-married women, AWFACTT serves as a multiplier to create total population figures for all women of childbearing age, following the assumptions noted above.\n\nThe width of AWFACTT ranges from a low of 3 to a high of 5 in the original DHS files; see Comparability for further discussion.","AWFACTU is a 5-digit variable (in IPUMS-DHS) with 2 implied decimal places that is used to create total population estimates by urban versus rural residence for all women of childbearing age, for those samples interviewing only ever-married women.\n\nA post from DHS senior staff member Tom Pullum on the DHS Users Forum explains the use of the AWFACT adjustment variables as follows:\nThe all-woman factors are needed when you are trying to estimate something for all women, but you have to work with ever-married women because that's all you have in the sample.

DHS surveys collect information about the woman's age through questions about age at last birthday and date of birth.  DHS Recode Manuals provide the following information about how the AGE variable is calculated:\nCurrent age in completed years is calculated from the century month code of the date of birth of the respondent (V011) and the century month code of the date of interview (V008). In a few cases the age in the data file will be different from that reported by the respondent when the respondent's birthday was in the month of interview, but she had not yet had her birthday.

If the woman reported more than 20 births, then the number for CHEB will exceed the number of births in the birth history, but such cases are rare.","CURRWORK (V714) indicates whether the woman is currently working at a job or business.  To distinguish employment from household labor, many surveys included a preface such as the following: \"As you know, some women take up jobs for which they are paid in cash or in kind.  Others sell things, have a small business or work on the family farm or in the family business.\" Women who have worked outside of their own housework in the last 12 months and been paid in cash, cash and in-kind, or only in-kind payments are included as working, although the survey questions vary in who receives an affirmative response. See Comparability.","WEALTHQ (V190) refers to the relative wealth of the household where the woman lives, divided into quintiles from the poorest (code 1) to the richest (code 5).  The wealth index is defined in the DHS Recode Manuals as follows:\nThe wealth index is a composite measure of a household's cumulative living standard. The wealth index is calculated using easy-to-use data on a household's ownership of selected assets, such as televisions and bicycles; materials used for housing construction; and types of water access and sanitation facilities.Generated with a statistical procedure known as principal components analysis, the wealth index places individual households on a continuous scale of relative wealth. DHS separates all interviewed households into five quintiles of wealth.For additional information about the calculation and meaning of the wealth index, users should consult the summary information about the wealth index on The DHS Program website here and/or the DHS Comparative Report on \"The DHS Wealth Index\" here.\n\nThe complementary variable WEALTHS reports the wealth index factor score for the woman's household in a specific sample.  WEALTHQ and WEALTHS are included on the woman's record for Phase 5 forward only.  IPUMS-DHS has made available these variables for Phase 2 forward, by linking the wealth index files to the woman's individual recode files.\n\nThe variables used to calculate wealth index quintiles and the level of wealth implied by a specific ranking are sample-specific.  See Comparability.","WEALTHS (V191) refers to the household’s wealth index value generated by the product of standardized scores (z-scores) and factor coefficient scores (factor loadings) of wealth indicators. Most researchers will want to use instead the complementary variable WEALTHQ (V190), which reports quintile ranking (from poorest to richest) of the woman's household, in terms of wealth score, for a given sample. \n\nFor further information about the calculation and meaning of the wealth index, see the description of WEALTHQ, the summary information about the wealth index on the DHS Program website here and/or the DHS Comparative Report on “The DHS Wealth Index” here.\n\nThe variables used to calculate wealth index scores are sample-specific. See Comparability.","For women who ever went to school, EDUCLVL (V106) reports the highest level of school they attended. Countries vary in the gradations of their school systems, but EDUCLVL is a standardized variable reporting level of education in four broad categories: No education, Primary, Secondary, and Higher. \n\nThe DHS recode manuals state, \"In some countries the educational system does not fit naturally within this scheme, and a different categorization was used for the Final Report. In this case, this variable is constructed as accurately as possible from the country's own scheme, and the variable used for the Final Report is included as a country-specific variable.\"","EDYRTOTAL (V133) reports the woman's education level in single years.
